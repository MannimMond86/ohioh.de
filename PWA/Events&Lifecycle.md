## Installation & prepair:
For testing you can use our repository for the Research-App and  look to the ../public/ServiceWorker.js
If you want start by  zero the introduction "Step By Stey" in the React-Native-Folder will  help  you.
Use a browser that support ServiceWorkers. This link shows you all information you need: https://caniuse.com/serviceworkers
The browser needs https (TLS) Support. VERY IMPORTANT FOR SECURITY.
The ServiceWorker has  to be inside the scope of the project  folder.

## Usage:
Events are the code in  the ServiceWorker-File.
They cache app content, perform the background processing,request for push notification (  or handle them ).
Events are the nice way since ES6 to set up individual stragies for your need to create a great user-experiance.
