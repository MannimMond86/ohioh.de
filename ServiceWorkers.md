## Service Worker:

# Definition from Mozilla:
"A service worker is an event-driven worker registered against an origin and a path. It takes the form of a JavaScript file that can control the web-page/site that it is associated with, intercepting and modifying navigation and resource requests, and caching resources in a very granular fashion to give you complete control over how your app behaves in certain situations (the most obvious one being when the network is not available).

A service worker is run in a worker context: it therefore has no DOM access, and runs on a different thread to the main JavaScript that powers your app, so it is non-blocking. It is designed to be fully async; as a consequence, APIs such as synchronous XHR and Web Storage can't be used inside a service worker.

Service workers only run over HTTPS, for security reasons. Having modified network requests, wide open to man in the middle attacks would be really bad. In Firefox, Service Worker APIs are also hidden and cannot be used when the user is in private browsing mode."

avaible for following browsers:

 "Multi-Thread" ( or two single Thread)  usage, this is an awesome feature that pwa support.Your basics like the DOM are running on a single thread. In normal everything you add in Js will added as workload to this thread. The ServiceWorker has a decoupled thread for usage. This push up the usability and performance on a nice way. This seperated Thread will still alaive if the browser is closed. Like a background Service that only need needs the visaul performance of the device whenn the user want to see the content of the application.Or in short "stay tuned and same time safe energy".
The Service Workers make sure that only the needed JS-Files are used which are needed for the advantage of the users.

Service Workers are only runing with https:. This means that only secure traffics from secure Hosts are allowed by default.

# Strategies for ServiceWorkers:
https://blog.bitsrc.io/5-service-worker-caching-strategies-for-your-next-pwa-app-58539f156f52
1.Stale-While-Revalidate
2.Cache first, then Network
3.Network first, then Cache
4.Cache only
5.Network only



# Event: Source

# Fetch-API: 
Browser or Page-related JavaScript initiales a fetch like http request over the proxy-server.
The only way how this will not happen is a normal xml-https Request or from packages like Axios that base on it.

index.html ->(loads)-> app.js -> (register)-> Fetch Event triggers the ServiceWorker and wake it up.

# Push Notification:
Like the communication way over the used Browser-Server. Our OHIOH Servers can communicate over this way with the Browser and the App at the device (to the client).
This works on the Service Worker Thread.

index.html ->(loads)-> app.js -> (register)-> ServiceWorker.js->(install)*-> Install Event from the cache. or *->(activated)->Activation Event->(backgrounded)-Y IDLE Mode ->(after time)-> terminated "sleeping" Rewake when Events are coming in

# Background Sync:
