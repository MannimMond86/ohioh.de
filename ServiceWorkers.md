# Event: Source

# Fetch-API: 
Browser or Page-related JavaScript initiales a fetch like http request over the proxy-server.
The only way how this will not happen is a normal xml-https Request or from packages like Axios that base on it.

# Push Notification:
Like the communication way over the used Browser-Server. Our OHIOH Servers can communicate over this way with the Browser and the App at the device (to the client).
This works on the Service Worker Thread.
