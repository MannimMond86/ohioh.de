Logical structur:
 for the now coder reader to  dive into the project
 1. Name policy  Wikipage name and header:
 xxxx.md [for normal informations which are understandable for both sides]
 xxx-Coders.md [  i guess this helps the not coder to see that is is to hard]
 
Then  next structur of the index as a logical  sort (Order):
From Easy to Hard  and  like in a book sorted in  chapters  ? [or what you  think about,Satyam?]
Mainpage content down  (  not   finsih but this should be with  the index at the mainpage,or? )

Mainpage( ReadMe.md )

OHIOH APP is an open source implementation in the OHIOH Framework.

OHIOH App is a part of the OHIOH Products, which uses privacy-preserving protocol for community-driven contact tracing across borders, with the opportunity to select geolocation tracing, like GPS.

Its aim is to flatten the curve of pandemics and potentially detect them before they spread widely. To effectively contain the spread of a virus health officials use the approach of test, trace and quarantine.

When an individual is determined to be infected , the officialâ€™s task is to determine who might have been in close enough proximity to this person, to be infected. Testing/ quarantining those individuals quickly is one of the effective strategies to curb the spread of infection further. However, such a method, without information is ineffective as well as inefficient.

The OhIOH APP, allows participating devices to log encounters with each other, in order to facilitate epidemiological contact tracing, while protecting the user's personal data and privacy.
