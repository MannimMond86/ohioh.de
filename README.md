As you have mentioned our github looks a bit different. At the moment you are in the main repository. This repository has more text and documentation.
The reason is that we wish to give you as a new user an easy description to the project by it self and then go with you to the repository you are interested at.
On more benifit on this way is that it is easier to handle. All Documentations are here. For you as a user it is easiert to follow aspecially to see updates in the update section.For us as voluntary for you it is easier to handle and stay tuned too.

The goal of this documentation is to make an understandable possibility to look in the code as a non-coder. Maybe you will not unterstand all at the beginning but if your are interested you should get a start as easy as possible.

# Goal: 

[glimpse: field research, App-development, public health, risk scoring]

We are a collective of voluntary helpers and student from all over the world. Togehter we work at the OHIOH ("Our Helath In Our Hands") Workgroup to explore newst technologies, Protocols (like GAEN or TCN) and User-Behavior to publish public Documents. On this way we want to help to fight corona and non-pandemics like flue. Educational work is nessesary to give the users of tracing App and influenced person a fair chance to decide the own privat way to use APPs. For further information we publish technologies which helps public Authorities like school, universities or Town halls to define there individual risk places and develop fact oriented instructions for action and the restart after covid-19.
