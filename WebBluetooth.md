# Web Bluetooth:

This new way to use Bluetooth can open a complete new way of interacting with Bluetooth.
It controls Blietooth Low energy device like heart rate or glucose monitors, all kind of sensore, home appliances and other devices.
This Technologie can be used in all way. The client can be the host at the same time. A great way to communicate.
This idea followes the mindset of open source deeply. that is why we decided for this young technolgy.
We will create an open source control interfaces for near the GAEN and TCN Protocol.


Energy:

This is an often discussed them in the world of tracing. For us as researcher who are deeply interested in the userview that discussion is the same important.
We only make research that is usable in normal life and not in a labor.
In Bluetooth Low Energy devices can perform one of two roles.As a “Central” (your phone) or a “Peripheral” (a above called hardware, headset other device).


The Bluetoothdevice by itself:

The Bluetooth sensor is in general only on functional platin on your mainboard ( from the smartphone ).
This sensor has a lot of services which are or are not ever avaible ( like the GAEN ).
You maybe have seen this battery status of your headset at you smartphone screen.
This is a service ( like a specific protocol that as a sensor of the headset about this battery). The answer is a number.
The same with health data or audio. Different protocols can run ( when it is allowed ) at the same time or interval.
Music audio stream is after activation a permanent running service as long as you want to listen to music.
The request of the battery service is in the most cases in interval.

This services are declaired by the Bluetooth SIG Group.

Check it out:

First, you need to enable Developer Mode in Android.
Next, go to Settings, then open “Developer Options” and turn on the “Enable Bluetooth HCI snoop log.”
This will start recording all the Bluetooth traffic that goes through your device.
Then use Wireshark to open the Bluetooth log. More we are not allowed to explain ;-)
