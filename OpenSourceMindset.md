On important step for beeing open source is to publish the source code.
A lot of general informations how to get open source you will find from our partner the Linux Foundation.
This guide help to get started with opensourse mindset at an awesome way.

There is one other point that is important for us:

# Complete transparency:

This is possible with the progressive web app way that we follow.
Befor you install something you can test in chromebrowser and lighthouse on a very deep way.You really see each traffic,
Information above the traffic ( Network ) etc. 

This way is not possible ( or only very hard ) if you "only" install a app from the app store.
Our goal is not to make other apps bad. We wish to give you with our way a new and deep way to understand what your APP is directly doing.
