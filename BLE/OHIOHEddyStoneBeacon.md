Setting up a beacon with Eddystone:
Beacons that meet the full Eddystone specification can be provisioned to broadcast using any tool that implements the Eddystone Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) service. The Google Beacon Tools app for Android and iOS can be used to provision a beacon, as well as to attach content to the beacon that can be exposed through your apps.

Maybe we can glue such a Beacon as a Sticker to the user Device :-)
