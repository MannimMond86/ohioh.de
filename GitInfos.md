# IMPORTANT:
test
We are working with a fork of the PathCheckRepository.
It can happen that we work in different ways with the Project.
To bring the split to a minimum we try to merge the original pathcheck repository to a seperated Account. There we can manual compare the differences and try to run the origin from PathCheck concatinated with our actual data from the Device ( which should ofcourse been up to date).
if everything is running we can merge the TransferAccount with our ohioh account.


We recognized that it can be helpful using next to your terminal the software
1.Gitkraken for the ohioh account 
2.Github Desktop to your privat account


# How to use:
use your terminal to handle your work

Good to know:
remote repository - this is the repository hosted by github on the server
initial repository  - your folder with the data

pull - (down)  pull the latest change from the remote repository to our local repository 
fetch - (down)
push - (up) to the repository that you point example: $ git push -u origin master ( or in our case develop)
Before you start check out how git works. If you know where you git head is at the moment you are ready to rock.
