We use CSS MEdia Quesries to adjust Layout& Design.

We try to influence the world of tracing from different fields and views.

On is to make the APP Experiance for the use extreme comprehensible and understandable.

For this implementation of goals we need and combination of traditional App Coding ( JavaScript with React+(Native) ) and html & css.
An important file for this to understand the schema is the material.{primary}-{accent}.min.css ormaterial.{primary}-{accent}.min.js File in our repository.
Test it yourself by open our APP-Page in Chrome and open the Dev Tools -> Elements. Now move the size of the App-View-Field and you see that the code is reacting on your choice of the View size. Look to the class changes in the file "..is-small-screen".


This brings the user a reponsive Experiance
